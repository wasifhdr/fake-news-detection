## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning model designed to detect and classify news articles as either **Real** or **Fake**. With the rapid spread of misinformation on social media, automated systems like this help in verifying the authenticity of news sources effectively.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib
* **Model:** [Insert Algorithm Name, e.g., PassiveAggressiveClassifier / Logistic Regression / LSTM]

## 📂 Dataset
The model was trained on the WELFake dataset.
* **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification
* **Size:** 70,000 fake and true news articles
* **Preprocessing:** Removed stopwords, performed stemming/lemmatization, and vectorized text using TF-IDF.
